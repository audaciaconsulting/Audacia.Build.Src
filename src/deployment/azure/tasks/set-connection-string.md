# Set SQL Connection String Step

## Contents
- [Reason](#reason) - Reason for pipeline step
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - Requirements to use pipeline tasks
- [Usage](#usage) - How to use the step in a pipeline

## Reason
This is being done as workaround due to an [issue](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/1440) with Terrform provisioning in Azure, where the application of database connections are not unique per deployment slot.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following lines are added to your build pipeline.yaml
```yaml
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: templates
      type: git
      name: Audacia/Audacia.Build
```
For a broader understanding of yaml pipelines in azure read the following [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema#yaml-basics).

You will also need an Azure Service Principle creating which has access to your deployed environment. This can be done in Azure Devops by going to Project Settings > Service Connections > New Service Connection.

## Usage

Sets the database connection string on a Deployment Slot for an Azure Web Application.
