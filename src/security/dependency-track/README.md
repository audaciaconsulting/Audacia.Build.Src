# Dependency-Track Pipeline Templates

These Azure Pipelines templates automate SBOM generation, upload to OWASP Dependency-Track, and optional deactivation of non-latest project versions.

## What is Dependency-Track?

[OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) stores and analyses CycloneDX SBOMs for your applications, identifying vulnerabilities, license issues, and policy violations across your portfolio.
Each upload creates or updates a project and version in Dependency-Track, which the platform monitors continuously.

## Two Ways to Run

| Approach         | When to use                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modular / Staged | You want Generate, Upload, and Deactivate as separate stages for control and visibility.          |
| End-to-End       | You want a single job that runs the whole flow in one go. Great for small repos or a quick start. |

> **Implementation note:**
> When using the SBOM generator templates (`generate-dotnet-sbom.steps.yaml`, `generate-npm-sbom.steps.yaml` and `generate-pnpm-sbom.steps.yaml`), the `publishArtifact` variable controls whether each generator publishes its output as a pipeline artifact.
>
> - **If you are running only one generator** (for example, just the .NET or npm template), set `publishArtifact: true` to publish its SBOMs directly.
> - **If you are running multiple generators** (for example, both .NET and npm), set `publishArtifact: false` on each generator and add a single `PublishPipelineArtifact@1` step afterwards. This publishes a single combined artifact (e.g. `sbom-files`) containing all SBOM outputs.
>
> This approach ensures:
> - A single, consolidated SBOM artifact for multi-ecosystem projects
> - No duplicate or conflicting artifact names
> - Consistent behaviour between modular (staged) and end-to-end pipeline designs

## Including the pnpm template

Reference `Audacia.Build` as a repository resource, then include the template as steps:

```yaml
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: templates
      type: github
      endpoint: audacia-github-connection
      name: audaciaconsulting/Audacia.Build

pool:
  vmImage: "windows-latest"

steps:
  - template: /src/security/dependency-track/steps/generate-pnpm-sbom.steps.yaml@templates
    parameters:
      pnpmRoots: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/client
      # Optional: restrict to specific workspace packages, one pnpm --filter selector per line.
      packageFilters: |
        eportfolio
        admin
      publishArtifact: true
```

Set `publishArtifact: false` and publish once yourself if you are also running the .NET or npm generator — see the implementation note above.

### pnpm template parameters

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| `pnpmRoots` | `''` | Directories containing a `pnpm-lock.yaml`, one per line. **Empty means skip** — no steps run and the job stays green. |
| `packageFilters` | `''` | One pnpm `--filter` selector per line, applied within every root. Empty selects every workspace package. A selector matching nothing in any root fails the step. |
| `pnpmVersion` | `'11'` | pnpm version installed. `pnpm sbom` requires >= 11. |
| `nodeVersion` | `'22.x'` | Node version spec passed to `UseNode`. |
| `sbomSpecVersion` | `'1.6'` | CycloneDX spec version. **Do not raise without checking the target Dependency-Track accepts it** — see the note below. |
| `sbomType` | `'application'` | Component type recorded for the root package (`application` or `library`). |
| `lockfileOnly` | `false` | Skip the install and read only the lockfile. See the warning below before enabling. |
| `includeDevDependencies` | `true` | `false` maps to `--prod` (production and optional dependencies only). |
| `excludePeers` | `false` | Exclude peer dependencies and their exclusive subtrees. |
| `npmrcPaths` | `[]` | `.npmrc` paths to authenticate for private feeds. |
| `publishArtifact` | `false` | Publish this step's SBOM output as a pipeline artifact. |
| `artifactName` | `'sbom-files'` | Artifact name when publishing. |

> The `sbomSpecVersion` default is `1.6` rather than pnpm's own default of `1.7` because Dependency-Track v4.14.3 rejects 1.7 with `HTTP 400 - Unrecognized specVersion 1.7`.

## Prerequisites

### 1) Variable group with secrets

To authenticate with your Dependency-Track instance, you must provide an API key to the pipeline. Store this key securely using your preferred secret management mechanism (such as a variable group, environment variable, or secret store) and ensure it is accessible to the pipeline at runtime.

If using Azure DevOps, you can store the key as a secret in a variable group or connect it to Azure Key Vault. For other CI/CD systems, follow the recommended approach for securely managing secrets in your environment.

### 2) Variables configured in the pipeline (optional)

These are defined as pipeline variables within each YAML file or via the “Variables” tab in Azure DevOps.

| Variable               | Purpose                                                                                 | Example                              |
| ---------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------ |
| `envName`              | Which environment this SBOM represents                                                  | `dev`, `qa`, `uat`, `prod`           |
| `version`              | Optional project version value used on upload. If set, this takes precedence over inferred SBOM versions. | `main`                               |
| `additionalTags`       | Optional extra tags recorded on the Dependency-Track project                            | `owner:team-x,service:abc`           |
| `deactivateOld`        | Whether to mark all older versions inactive after upload                                | `true`                               |
| `parentProjectName`    | Optional parent “container” in Dependency-Track                                         | `OrganisationName - ApplicationName` |
| `parentProjectVersion` | Version of the parent (may be left empty)                                               | `2025.10` or empty                   |
| `waitForProcessing`    | Whether to wait for BOM processing in Dependency-Track before finishing the upload step | `true`                               |

> ⚠️ Parent projects must match on both name and version exactly (case-sensitive) in Dependency-Track for the link to be established. If the version is left empty or no exact match exists, uploads still succeed but no parent link is created.

## Project Versioning

Dependency-Track uses the version supplied during the upload step. If the upload template's `version` parameter is set, that manually defined value takes precedence over any version in the generated SBOM.

If `version` is left empty, the upload step uses `metadata.component.version` from the SBOM when available. For .NET SBOM generation, when `inferVersionFromProject` is enabled, the effective precedence is:

1. The manually supplied upload `version` parameter.
2. `PackageVersion`, then `Version`, in the nearest `Directory.Build.props` found by walking up from the `.csproj` directory within the repository working directory.
3. `PackageVersion`, then `Version`, in the `.csproj`.

If no version is found, the project version is uploaded as an empty string.

## Specifying Projects for SBOM Generation

When specifying a .NET project, the template expects a `.csproj` file to be specified.
Examples might include:

- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Api/YourProject.Api.csproj`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Functions/YourProject.Functions.csproj`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Identity/YourProject.Identity.csproj`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Seeding/YourProject.Seeding.csproj`

When specifying an npm project, the template expects **the directory** that contains the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
Examples might include:

- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Ui`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/apps`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/playwright`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/performance`

When specifying a pnpm project, the template expects **the directory** that contains the `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
Pass one directory per line via `pnpmRoots`. Examples might include:

- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/client`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/tests/playwright`

Both pnpm topologies are supported, determined by whether a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sits alongside the lockfile:

- **Workspace** — one SBOM per workspace package. The workspace root itself is excluded, as it is a private aggregator rather than a deployable component. Use `packageFilters` (one pnpm `--filter` selector per line) to restrict which packages are included; omit it for all of them.
- **Single package** — one SBOM for the package itself.

Optional `.npmrc` paths can also be provided for authentication against private feeds.  
Each `.npmrc` will be authenticated separately using `npmAuthenticate@0` before SBOM generation.
This applies to both the npm and pnpm templates, as pnpm also reads `.npmrc`.

The templates will:

- Generate .NET SBOMs via `dotnet CycloneDX` for each listed `.csproj`.
- Generate npm SBOMs via `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` for each listed SPA root folder (where `package.json` lives).
  If `package-lock.json` isn’t present, the step will create one and run a minimal install for resolution.
  When license text inclusion is enabled, `npm ci` is used for full dependency restoration.
- Generate pnpm SBOMs via pnpm's own `pnpm sbom` command for each package in each listed pnpm root.
  A `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` runs first so the SBOM reflects the installed tree.

> The template automatically installs the necessary tools (`CycloneDX`, `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` and `pnpm`) if not already available.
>
> ⚠️ **The pnpm template requires pnpm 11 or later**, as `pnpm sbom` was added in pnpm v11.0.0. The `pnpmVersion` parameter controls the version installed and defaults to `11`.
>
> ⚠️ Do not enable the pnpm template's `lockfileOnly` parameter without re-validating the output. Reading the lockfile alone rather than the installed tree was measured against a real workspace to drop 463 of 1441 components (and add 102 others) **while still exiting successfully** — an incomplete SBOM that reports no error and shows no failure in the pipeline log.

## Naming Note

Before running the pipeline, verify that the names defined in your `.csproj` and `package.json` files are correct, consistent, and descriptive.
Dependency-Track uses these names directly from the SBOMs to create or update projects.

Avoid:

- Too generic names (`"App"`, `"WebApplication1"`)
- Duplicates across repositories
- Inconsistent naming across components

Recommended naming conventions:

- Backends: `Company.Product.Component`
- Frontends: `company-product-ui`

Ensure names reflect the deployable artifact or service that will appear in reports.

## Project Tags in Dependency-Track

The pipeline templates support adding tags to each project if required, enabling enhanced organization and filtering within Dependency-Track.

In Dependency-Track, tags appear under each project and support filtering, dashboards, and portfolio access control.

The upload step builds tags like:

- `env:<envName>` when `envName` is set
- Optional comma-separated `additionalTags` (for example `owner:team-app,service:tickets`)

## Parent Project Linking

If you provide `parentProjectName`, the upload attempts to set `parentName` and `parentVersion` for each SBOM.
Dependency-Track performs parent resolution via **exact name and version match (case-sensitive)**.
If no exact match is found, the child projects still upload successfully but remain unlinked.

Use the convention `"<Client> - <System>"` for all parent project names to keep the portfolio consistent.

## Latest and Active Version Handling

When `waitForProcessing` is `true`, the upload step waits for Dependency-Track to finish processing each BOM and then promotes the uploaded `projectName + projectVersion` so it is marked as both latest and active.

## Deactivate Non-Latest Versions

After the uploaded version has been promoted, older versions of each project (where `isLatest=false`) are set to inactive.
This keeps the UI focused on the current release while preserving historical versions for audit.

## npm Dependency Tree Warnings

If `npm ls` detects issues such as missing dependencies, invalid versions, or peer conflicts,  
the SBOM generation step logs a warning (for example `npm error code ELSPROBLEMS`).  
This does **not** block SBOM generation or upload. The task completes as “Succeeded with issues”,  
and Dependency-Track still receives the SBOM. Developers should resolve dependency tree issues  
to maintain accurate evidence and reproducibility.

## Azure DevOps Output

- Generate → SBOM file list and counts
- Upload → summary of projects and versions
- Deactivate → Confirmation of inactive versions set
